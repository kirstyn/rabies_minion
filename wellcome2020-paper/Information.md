# Primer schemes  
Multiplex primer schemes for rabies virus whole genome sequencing, designed using Primal Scheme (http://primal.zibraproject.org/)  
rabvTanzDg= primers designed to target Tanzanian rabies virus  
rabvSEasia= primers designed to target SE Asia lineages of rabies virus  

# Protocols  
Full "sample-to-sequence" laboratory protocol for sequencing rabies virus samples on the MinION platform

# Sequence data  
Rabies virus consensus sequence datasets used for the publication "Rapid in-country sequencing of whole virus genomes to inform rabies elimination programmes" (Brunker et al, In Prep).  
Gel results from PCR validation tests on archived RABV samples.
