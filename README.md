# Rabies-minion  
Latest pipelines for nanopore based rabies virus (RABV) sequencing. Pipelines are forked from the ARTIC networks base template (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-base) and modified to be RABV specific.

# install  
To install the rabies `Conda` environment use:

```
conda env create -f environment_rabies.yml -n <environment name>
```

Where `<environment_name>` is the name you want to use (probably the same as the repo).

Then activate the environment using:

```
conda activate <environment name>
```
